# BuyerStop

Developed an app that would provide map interface to find the sellers, get complete navigation details, allow the person to chat with the seller or rate him. Everything happened in real time.

Created a backend which registers the user to the Firebase database. Firebase is used for storage and management of all data, be it images, google token, username, etc. Allowed functionality of Google Login. For this used Google OAuth API which was linked to Firebase.

Allowed the seller to post advertisements, upload image or capture image as per his convenience.      	                                                                             
The app had a fully functional map with location and path showing abilities.

Used FireBase, Google Maps API, Google Location Picker, and Android Studio.
